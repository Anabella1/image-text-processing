# Image and Text Processing Project

This repository contains work on **Image and Text Processing**.  
The project focuses on applying machine learning and deep learning techniques to both image and text datasets.  

## Project Tasks
1. **Image Classification** – Identifying plant species (e.g., charlock vs. cleavers) using classical ML models and CNNs.  
2. **Sentiment Analysis** – Classifying Amazon product reviews into sentiment categories using text preprocessing and NLP models.  

## Methods & Approaches
- Image preprocessing and feature extraction (HOG, CNN).  
- Text preprocessing with TF-IDF and deep learning (LSTM).  
- Model evaluation using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and Confusion Matrices.  

## Tools & Libraries
- Python, Jupyter Notebook  
- scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras  
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn  

## Results
- Compared performance of classical ML vs. deep learning approaches on both tasks.  
- Demonstrated effective image feature extraction and NLP preprocessing pipelines.
